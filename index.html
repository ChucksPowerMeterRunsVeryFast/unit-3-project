			<p>My favorite animal are spiders, I like spiders because a lot of people don't like spiders and some of them are pretty cute. <br> I think that spiders are pretty cool because they can make their own home out of stuff they make from their body. <br> Another thing I like about them is how they catch their food. Some catch their food by waiting for something to get <br> stuck in their web and then trap them in even more silk. Others go hunting for their food. Another thing I like about <br> spiders is how some can see things that we cannot see. Salticidae spiders (jumping spiders) can see UVA and UVB light, <br> this can help them communicate with other spiders.</p>

			<p>Spiders can be really cool and scary, one way spiders are cool is that they can work together and <br> make really big webs. These webs are very pretty, they are usually made on trees and collect dew <br> in the moring making them extra pretty. Some things that make spiders scary is that some can be <br> poisonous. How ever "only a small number are said to be dangerous, and less than 30 (less than <br> one-tenth of one percent) have been responsible for human deaths." according to <a href = https://www.britannica.com/list/9-of-the-worlds-deadliest-spiders>britannica.com</a>. <br> Another things that can be very scarry about spiders is that they hide and scare you, but they are <br> just hiding from you and don't want to see you because they are scared of you.  </p>
